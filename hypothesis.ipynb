      "   - Alternative Hypothesis (H1): The mean weekly operating cost is greater than the theoretical mean (μ > 4000 Rs).\n",

      "4. **Decision Making:**\n",
      "   - We compare the adjusted p-value (one-tailed) to the alpha level (0.05).\n",
      "   - If the p-value is less than 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis. Otherwise, we fail to reject it.\n",
